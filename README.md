# ðŸ’§ Water Potability Prediction

This project focuses on building a **machine learning model** to predict whether water is **safe for human consumption (potable)** or not, based on its physicochemical properties.

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Objective

To develop a classification model that can accurately predict if a water sample is **potable (safe to drink)** using features like pH, hardness, solids, chloramines, sulfate, conductivity, organic carbon, trihalomethanes, and turbidity.

## ðŸ“Š Dataset

- **Source**: [Kaggle - Water Potability Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/adityakadiwal/water-potability)
- **Total Samples**: 3,276
- **Target Variable**: `Potability`  
  - `1` â†’ Safe to drink  
  - `0` â†’ Not safe to drink
